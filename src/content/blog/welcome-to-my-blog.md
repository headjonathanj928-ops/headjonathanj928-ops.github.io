## Hello, World!

Welcome to my dev journal! I'm Jonathan, and I'm excited to start sharing my journey in software development with you.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover three main areas:

### Software Development

I'll share insights on coding best practices, architecture decisions, and lessons learned from building software. Whether it's debugging tricky issues or exploring new technologies, expect practical content you can apply to your own projects.

### Career Insights

The tech industry is constantly evolving, and navigating a career in software development comes with its own challenges. I'll share my experiences, tips for professional growth, and observations from the industry.

### Tutorials

Step-by-step guides to help you learn new skills. From beginner-friendly introductions to more advanced topics, I aim to make complex concepts accessible.
